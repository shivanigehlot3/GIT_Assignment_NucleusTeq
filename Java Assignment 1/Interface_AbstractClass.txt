---- Explain the concept of interfaces and abstract classes with examples. ----

Interfaces:

Interface is a blueprint of a class.
All methods in interface are public, abstract and without any implementation. They must be implemented by the class that implements the interface.
Interface is used to achieve total abstraction.
Varibles in the interface are final, public and static by default.
Interface cannot have constructors as it cannot instantiated.
Multiple Inheritance is achieved using interfaces as a class can implement multiple interfaces.

Example for interface : InterfaceConcept.java  (code is in this file).


Abstract Classes: 

Abstract class can contain both abstract method as well as concrete methods with implementation.
WE cannot create an instance of abstract class.
Abstract class can have constructors. 
Even though we canâ€™t instantiate an abstract class directly, its constructor is called when a subclass object is created.

Example for Abstract Class : AbstractClassConcept.java (code is in this file).
