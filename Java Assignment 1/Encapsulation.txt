---- Explain the concept of encapsulation with a suitable example. ----

Enacapsulation: 

Encapsulatin is a fundamental object-oriented programming principle in java.
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together into a single unit, usually a class.
Encapsulation makes sure that the sensitive data is hidden from the users.
We make the class variables or attributes as private. To access these attributes, we use getter and setter methods.

Example : 
class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
    }
}

public class Encapsulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student student = new Student();

        student.setName("John");
        student.setAge(20);

        System.out.println("Name: " + student.getName());
        System.out.println("Age: " + student.getAge());
    }
}


Here, as we declare the name and age variable as private, we cannot directly access these variables simply by using ---> student.name or student.age. We have to use getName() and getAge() method.
Also we cannot update their values directly by using ---> student.name="Shivani" or student.age=22. We have to use setName() or setAge() method to update them.
